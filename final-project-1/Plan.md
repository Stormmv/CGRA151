## Student name: Michael Visser
## Student ID: 300652084
## Name of game/artwork: Ghecko Game

## Vision

1. Game concept: 
The ghecko game is a twist on the origional snake game where the player has to move a ghecko around on the screen and collect food using the gheckos mouth. once the food is collected, the gheckos tail grows making it longer. the player must avoid the gheckos tail and the walls of the screen. the game ends when the ghecko collides with its tail or the wall.
2. Game play: 
The ghecko will be moved around using the W, A, S, and D keys. the ghecko will be able to eat the food usin gits mouth. there will be two modes, easy and hard. in easy the ghecko can move through the walls of the screen. in hard the ghecko will die if it collides with the wall. the ghecko will also die if it collides with its tail in either modes. there will be a scoreboard that will display the players score. the score will be the length of the gheckos tail. at the end of the game the player can enter their name and the score will be saved to a highscore list.
3. Visual design: 
The ghecko will be a green square with a red square for its mouth. the food will be a black square simulating a fly. the walls will be a black outline going around the edge of the screen. the scoreboard will be a white square with black text. the highscore list will be a white square with black text. the background will be a sandy colored background.
